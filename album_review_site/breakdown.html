            <p>
                The instrumentals and production on this album is one of a kind. The album makes
                use of natural instruments and electronic synths making for a funky energetic
                sound and in some songs a slow and romantic feel. With a wide array of sounds 
                ranging from energetic trumpets and tamborines in songs like "Fly as Me" and "777" 
                to Smooth drums in songs like "Leave the Door Open". These beats really embody 
                the 70s-80s feel in the best way possible.

            <p>
                Not only does this album have outstanding beats, but those beats are accompanied 
                by lyrics that fit them perfectly. When the beat is slower then the lyrics
                will be about heartbreak. On songs with this feel such as "Put on a Smile",
                Bruno Mars will take front stage with his soulfull singing that at times sounds
                like he is releasing all the agony in him through singing. On more upbeat songs
                like "Fly as Me", Anderson .Paak takes the mic, delivering lyrics that make 
                you feel like you are the flyest person on the planet. The album takes you 
                on a roller coaster that will have you go from feeling like nobody on earth is 
                as fresh as you, to wanting to stand at your ex's door with a boombox and beg 
                for her back.
