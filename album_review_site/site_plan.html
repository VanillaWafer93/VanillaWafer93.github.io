      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page is going to be a general introduction to the website.
        It will state the album that the website will be reviewing and explain to the 
        audience how I will be reviewing it. I will let them know what genre the album is 
        and that the breakdown will consist of the lyrics in the album, the beats/instrumentals,
        delivery of the lyrics and the overall feeling of the album. 
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Album Breakdown</h3>
      <p>
        This will be the main page for the website. This is going to be where the details 
        on the album are going to be. It will go over the lyrics of the album and what they represent/say first 
        so the audience can decide if they are interested in the lyrical content. Then it will go over the the beats and 
        instruments that are used throughout the album giving the audience an idea on what kind of beats to look forward to.
        It will then go over the delivery of the lyrics such as a calm and soothing delivery or a harsh and aggressive delivery.
        Finaly it will go over the overall feeling of the album to let the audience know if they are in for a fun and upbeat 
        experience or more of a serious and deep experience.

      <h3>Album Summary/rating</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be where I give an overall summary of the album and the contents that were presented to the audience.
        after giving a quick summary of the album it will present the audience with a rating out of 10 and the reasons
        behind the rating. It will then give a link to the album so that if the audience chooses, they can go and listen
        to it for themselves.
